Photos App Logo

The Photos App is a modern and user-friendly Android application developed using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It allows users to effortlessly browse and view both photos and videos from their device's internal storage. The app leverages the power of Jetpack Compose, a modern UI toolkit, to provide a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Key Features
- **Intuitive Navigation**: The app offers an intuitive and smooth navigation experience with a bottom navigation bar, allowing users to seamlessly switch between the Photos and Videos screens.

- **Dynamic UI Components**: Jetpack Compose's declarative syntax is used to create dynamic UI components, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface across different devices.

- **Photos Grid**: The Photos Grid screen beautifully presents the user's photos in a grid layout, allowing for easy browsing and selection. Jetpack Compose animations enhance the overall interaction.

- **Videos Grid**: Users can explore and watch their favorite videos using the Videos Grid screen, providing a fluid and responsive video playback experience.

- **Search**: The app allows users to search for photos and videos by name, using the Search screen. The search results are displayed in a grid layout, similar to the Photos Grid screen.

- **Audio List**: The Audio List screen displays all the audio files on the user's device, allowing them to play and manage their audio files.


## Code Sample - HomeScreen

```kotlin

@Composable
fun HomeScreen(
    navHostController: NavHostController,
    photosViewModel: PhotosViewModel,
    videoViewModel: VideoViewModel,
    audioViewModel: AudioViewModel,
) {
    val context = LocalContext.current
    val currentScreen = rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(Screens.HomeScreen.route) }
    val showAlertDialog = rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(false) }
    val bottomBarVisibility = rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(true) }
    val confirmDelete = rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(false) }
    val totalSelectedImages by photosViewModel.selectedImages.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    val totalSelectedAudios by audioViewModel.selectedAudios.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    val totalSelectedVideos by videoViewModel.selectedVideos.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    val photosSelectionInProgress = totalSelectedImages > 0
    val audioSelectionInProgress = totalSelectedAudios > 0
    val videoSelectionInProgress = totalSelectedVideos > 0
    val bottomSheetVisible =
        photosSelectionInProgress || audioSelectionInProgress || videoSelectionInProgress
    val memorySize = getTotalMemorySize(photosViewModel, audioViewModel, videoViewModel, context)
    val imageScreenListState = rememberLazyListState()
    val videoScreenListState = rememberLazyListState()
    val audioScreenListState = rememberLazyListState()
    val trashLauncher = rememberLauncherForActivityResult(
        contract = ActivityResultContracts.StartIntentSenderForResult()
    ) { result ->
        trashResult(
            result,
            audioSelectionInProgress,
            audioViewModel,
            context,
            videoSelectionInProgress,
            videoViewModel,
            photosViewModel
        )
    }

    HomeScreenContent(
        currentScreen,
        navHostController,
        photosViewModel,
        bottomBarVisibility,
        imageScreenListState,
        showAlertDialog,
        videoViewModel,
        audioViewModel,
        audioScreenListState,
        videoScreenListState,
        audioSelectionInProgress,
        videoSelectionInProgress,
        totalSelectedAudios,
        photosSelectionInProgress,
        totalSelectedImages,
        totalSelectedVideos,
        bottomSheetVisible,
        memorySize,
        context,
        trashLauncher,
        confirmDelete
    )
}
```


## MVVM Architecture
 The Photos App follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture:
 
- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the app. Manages data retrieval from internal storage.

- **View**: Declares the UI components and their layout using Jetpack Compose. Observes ViewModel data for dynamic updates.

- **ViewModel**: Manages and holds the UI-related data. Provides data to the View using LiveData or State.

## Video Playback with Media3 ExoPlayer
The app uses the Media3 ExoPlayer library to provide a seamless video playback experience:

- **VideoPlayer**: Custom Jetpack Compose composable for displaying and controlling video playback.
- **PlaybackPositionController**: Manages the playback position and state for video playback.
